## Pothole Detector Project
Road maintenance is a critical aspect of urban management, directly influencing safety and comfort for all traffic participants. One of the common issues that plague drivers, cyclists, and even pedestrians are potholes. Potholes can cause accidents, damage vehicles, and even impede emergency services. Addressing this issue promptly is essential for a safe and efficient transportation system. 


The goal is straightforward and quantifiable: to develop a multi-agents system capable of detecting potholes in real time with a high degree of accuracy and with a sufficiently high processing speed, marking detected potholes as dangerous or relatively safe by their width in the image. This system should be capable of being deployed in a vehicle or roadside monitoring equipment to identify and report the location of potholes to a central database. 


To achieve this goal, we need to accomplish several tasks: 

1. Collect and curate a dataset of road images that include various pothole conditions. 

2. Train the YOLOv8 model to recognize and accurately pinpoint potholes in these images. 

3. Develop a FastAPI backend capable of receiving image data from the detection system, processing it, and updating the central database in real-time. 

4. Carry out the necessary testing to ensure that the system is reliable and can work under different lighting and weather conditions. 

5. Show the ability to manage the system via Telegram bot and serve various clients such as other bots, web applications or simple clients connected to the server through a single API.

Using a multi-agent system for pothole detection is smart because: 
- It's Faster: Many scouts can check different areas at the same time. 

- It's Scalable: You can start with a few scouts and add more as you need them. 

- It's Flexible: Scouts can be on different vehicles and use different routes every day. 

- It's Robust: If one agent fails, the others will still be able to do their job. 

- It's Efficient: The manager can organize the information and make sure it's used well. 

By fulfilling these tasks, we aim to create a tool that not only improves road conditions but also enhances public safety and potentially saves on long-term road maintenance costs.  

 

 

Here's how and where we could use a multi-agent system for detecting potholes: 

- In City Buses: They travel all around the city every day. Each bus can have a camera that sends pictures to the server when it sees a pothole. 

- In Taxi Fleets: Taxis can have an app that lets drivers report potholes with a button click, and the location is sent to the server. 

- With Delivery Drones: As drones fly overhead, they can take pictures and report back potholes from a bird's eye view. 

- On Garbage Trucks: They cover nearly every street once a week, making them great for scouting potholes. 

- By Common People: Ordinary people can install a simple application on their phones. If they notice a pothole, they can take a picture, and it will immediately go to the server with the geolocation of the place and with all the necessary details in a single database. 

- By Various equipment of Road Services: Vehicles and road maintenance equipment such as wipers and snow plows or dedicated drones can be equipped with cameras and sensors. As they drive through the city to perform their usual maintenance tasks, they can simultaneously detect potholes and report them. This integration improves the efficiency of road services by combining maintenance with pothole detection. 

- By Google Glasses: People wearing Google Glasses or similar augmented reality devices can contribute to pothole detection and be instantly alerted to potential hazards. When a pit is detected, the glasses can automatically capture an image and send it to the server. This method is especially effective in low-light conditions, as glasses can improve visibility, making it easier to detect potholes and report them at night or in poorly lit places, saving people from possible injury. 

- Future Integration in Modern Cars: Looking ahead, modern cars equipped with advanced sensors and cameras can be utilized for pothole detection. These vehicles, especially those with features like heads-up displays, can project signs and information about the road surface, including potholes, directly onto the driver's windshield. This not only contributes to the pothole detection database but also immediately informs drivers about potential road hazards, enhancing safety.
